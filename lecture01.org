#+TITLE: The Curvature Tensor

* Curvature Tensors
- Riemann
- Ricci
- Scalar
* Symmetries of The Curvature Tensor
- First pair interchange
- Bianchi
- Second pair interchange
- Counting Dimensions
* Constant Sectional Curvature
- Kulkarni-Nomizu
* Surfaces
- Only one component
* Sub-manifolds
- Gauss equation
- In Euclidean space
* Ricci Decomposition
- Curvature like tensors (e.g K-N)
- Traces and K-N product are adjoints
- Weyl is what's left over!
- Irreducible decomposition
* Three Dimensions
- Vanishing Weyl
- Curvature tensor is K-N product of g and Schouten
